Potential Extensions:
1) Highliting current comparisions in-line using arrows 
2) Current iteration viewed in a larger textbox at the center of the screen and then added to the bottom dynamically below previous iterations.(just like now)
3)Use arrows for swaps(use another textbox with invisible arrows pointing to the start of each entry) and bold(or likewise) for current comparisons in the current iteration
4)fix max screensize
